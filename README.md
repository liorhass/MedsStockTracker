# MedsStockTracker
MedsStockTracker tracks your medicines stock.
It doesn't tell you when you should take your medicines, how much to take, etc.
It only tells you when your medicine stock is going to run out, and it alerts you when it is time to re-stock.
MedsStockTracker is intended to be used only with medicines that are taken regularly,
such as medicines for chronic conditions. It cannot be used with medicines that are taken irregularly
such as medicines for headache relief that are only taken when needed.

For each medicine that you're tracking, you tell MedsStockTracker the daily dosage,
and the amount available at that time. Every time you re-stock, you update the app so it can track your inventory.
From this information MedsStockTracker tries to predict when your stock will run low,
and it alerts you in advance so you will have plenty of time to re-stock before your medicines will run out.

IMPORTANT NOTE: MedsStockTracker is just a convenience tool.
It should never be used as a primary tool to manage critical medicine supply.
