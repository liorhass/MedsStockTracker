    It should never be used as a primary tool to manage critical medicine supply.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>General</h3>
<p>
MedsStockTracker (MST) tracks your medicines inventory. It doesn't tell you when you should take your
    medicines, how much to take, etc. It only tells you when your medicine stock is going to
    run out, and it alerts you when it is time to re-stock.</p>
<p>For each medicine that you're tracking, you tell MST the daily dosage, and the amount available.
Every time you re-stock, you update the app so it can track your inventory.
From this information MST tries to predict when your stock will run low, and it alerts you some
time in advance.
</p>

<h3>Notification Severity Levels</h3>
Notifications have two severity levels: <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Warning</span> and
<span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Critical</span>.<p>When the estimated stock of a certain medicine
gets too low, you will receive a daily "Warning Notification" until you re-stock and update the app.
If you do not re-stock and the estimated stock of that medicine drops even further, you will receive
    a daily "Critical Notification".</p><p> The app decides when to issue
each type of notification according to "Stock Thresholds" that you define in Settings. These thresholds are
    explained in the next section.</p>

<h3>Stock Thresholds</h3>
In the Settings screen, you define two "stock thresholds"
<span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Warning stock threshold</span> and
<span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Critical stock threshold</span>.
<p>
    Both thresholds are define in days. They define at what stock level the app starts issuing notifications.</p>
<p>
    For example, if you set the Warning threshold to 14 days and the Critical threshold to 7 days,
    you will get daily Warning notifications for every medication with stock that will last less
    than 14 days. For medicines with even lower stock, that won't last even for 7 days, you will get
    a daily Critical notification instead.
</p>
<h3>Earliest time for notifications</h3>
MST only issues notifications once a day. Once you dismiss a notification, you won't be bothered
again until the next day. So MST has to decide when is a good time in the day to issue its notifications.
<p>
    You cannot determine the exact time during the day for notifications to be delivered. You can
    however ask that they won't be delivered before a certain time. This is done in the settings
    screen by clicking on <span style="font-weight: bold;">Earliest time for notifications</span>.
    If your device is turn on when this time arrives, notifications will be delivered within at most
    20 minutes of that time. If your device is turned off when this time arrives, notifications will
    be delivered soon after it is turn back on.
</p>

<h3>Notifications Settings</h3>
Notifications settings depends on the Android version of your device:
<ul>
<li>
    On devices with Android v8.0 (Oreo) and newer, there are two notifications categories; One for
    "Critical" notifications, and one for "Warning" notifications. For each category you have full
    control over the notification characteristics such as tone, vibration, etc. This is done on
    dedicated screens that can be reached by clicking on "Notifications settings" in MST's settings
    screen, or alternatively, from Android's main settings screen.
</li>
<li>
    On devices with Android v7.1 (Nougat) and earlier, there is no distinction between different
    categories, and all the notifications parameters such as tone, vibration, etc, are controlled
    from MST's main settings screen itself.
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Medicines Stock Estimation</h3>
<p>
    Obviously, MST has no way of knowing the actual stock of your medicines. It estimates the current
    stock of each medicine based on the data you provide.
</p>
<p>
    For example, if five days ago you said that you have 42 pills of a certain medicine, and the daily
    dose of that medicine is two pills, MST estimates that you now have 32 pills.
</p>
<p>
    Note: MST assumes that the complete daily dose is consumed at once in the beginning of each day
    (i.e. at 00:01). So in the above example, if you made the update at 08:00 in the morning, MST
    will estimate the stock to be 42 pills for the rest of that day, 40 the next day, etc. It assumes
    that when you update the stock at 08:00, you already consumed your daily dose of that day.
</p>

<h3>Export/Import and Sharing</h3>
<p>
    In order to backup the medicines list or share it with someone else, is is possible
    to export and import the list as a file. To export the medicine list click on the "share" icon.
    This will generate a file containing the medicine list, and let you choose the
    sharing method (e.g. email, Google Drive, etc). In order to import a list you
    have to first download it to your phone. Then click the
    three-dot button at the right of the title bar, and select "Import from file".
    This opens a screen that let you choose a file from your phone storage. Select the
    file to import, and approve the import operation in the confirmation screen that opens.
